# DataScience-FeatureSelection
In this project I've created an algorithm that selects features on a dataset according to Plus-L Minus-R (LRS) and Mutual Information (MI). First one is a search strategy while second one is used like evaluation function.

Also I compare my algorithm with MIFS's one, PCA and the results of using all features in the dataset.
